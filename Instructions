Setup the Environment:
Import necessary libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib for visualization.

Create the Dataset:
Use Python to create a synthetic dataset. We'll make a small dataset for simplicity.

Data Preparation:
Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Further split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Build the Decision Tree Model:
Use Scikit-learn to create a DecisionTreeClassifier.
Train the model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model:
Make predictions on the test set.
Calculate the accuracy of the model.

Visualize the Decision Tree:
Use Matplotlib to visualize how the decision tree makes decisions.

Discuss the Results:
Interpret the decision tree.
Discuss how it can be used by the company to reduce customer churn.
